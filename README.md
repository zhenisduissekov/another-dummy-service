# Another Dummy Service

## About This Project
This is a **practice service** created for **learning and experimentation**, drawing heavily from existing examples. The project focuses on:

- Understanding foundational concepts.
- Extending and adapting existing code.
- Practicing software development techniques.

> **Note:** This project is for **educational purposes only** and is not intended for production use.

## Features
- **Basic HTTP service** for managing port data.
- **Bulk JSON uploads** for handling large datasets efficiently.
- **JSON-based input** for flexible data integration.
- **Unit and End-to-End (E2E) testing** for robust validation.
- **Modular architecture** with distinct layers for transport, logic, and storage.

## Technical Highlights
- **API-Driven**: Exposes HTTP endpoints for managing port data.
- **Testing**: Includes unit and E2E tests with Go's standard libraries.
- **Structure**: Follows clean architecture with modular design.
- **Use Case**: Designed for managing large datasets of ports, integrating with APIs, and bulk data processing.
